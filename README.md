# Yadladoc: reliable, tested code snippets in your documentation
Inspired by [knit](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-knit), [mdoc](https://github.com/scalameta/mdoc), [mdx](https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx) 

## Usage
### Basics
Yadladoc requires a `.ydoc` folder at the place of execution. You can leave it empty for the default configuration

- Run `java -jar ydoc.jar run README.md` to generate code from the code snippets in `README.md`

- Run `java -jar ydoc.jar check README.md` to check that the existing code matches what would be generated by a run on `README.md`

### Marking a snippet as an example
**TODO**

### Templates
**TODO**

## Install
### From source
Run `make ydoc.jar` to produce the executable jar `ydoc.jar` at the root of the repository

### From the release jar
**COMING SOON**
### From the release binary
**COMING SOON**

## Contribute
### Reading the tests
Most tests are written with a thin wrapper around munit assertions in a 'state what you expect' style.
Statements like these:
```scala ydoc.example=yadladoc/test/src/nyub/yadladoc/examples/assertions
        42 isEqualTo 42
```
Are equivalent to
```scala ydoc.example=yadladoc/test/src/nyub/yadladoc/examples/assertions
        assertEquals(42, 42)
```
